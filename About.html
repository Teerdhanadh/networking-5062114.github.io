        <h3>What is Computer Networking ?</h3>
        <img src="network.jpg"align="right"width="500px"height="250px">
        <p>A computer network is a system that connects numerous independent computers in order to share information (data) and resources. <br>
            The integration of computers and other different devices allows users to communicate more easily.</p>
            <p>
            A computer network is a collection of two or more computer systems that are linked together.<br> 
            A network connection can be established using either cable or wireless media. <br>
            Hardware and software are used to connect computers and tools in any network.</p>
            <p>
            A computer network consists of various kinds of nodes. Servers, networking hardware, personal computers, and other specialized<br> 
            or general-purpose hosts can all be nodes in a computer network. <br>
            Hostnames and network addresses are used to identify them.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Nodes Of Networks:-</h3>
            <p> Apart from any physical transmission media, networks are built from additional basic system building blocks, such as network interface controllers (NICs), repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, routers, modems, and firewalls.Any particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks and so may perform multiple functions.</p>
            <h4>Network Interfaces</h4>
            <img src="nic.jpg" align="right"width="300px"height="200px">
            <p> A network interface controller (NIC) is computer hardware that connects the computer to the network media and has the ability to process low-level network information. <br>
                For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.<br>
                In Ethernet networks, each network interface controller has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) addressâ€”usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. <br>
                To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness.<br>
                The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six octets. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, <br>
                using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.</p></img>

            <h4>Repeaters and Hubs</h4>
            <img src="repeator and hub.jpg" align="right"width="300px"height="200px">
            <p> A repeater is an electronic device that receives a network signal, cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. <br>
                The signal is retransmitted at a higher power level, or to the other side of obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. <br>
                In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters.<br>
                 With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.<br>

                Repeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. <br>
                This can cause a propagation delay that affects network performance and may affect proper function. <br>
                As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network.<br>
                
                An Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an Ethernet hub. In addition to reconditioning and distributing network signals, a repeater hub assists with collision detection and fault isolation for the network. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern network switches.</p>  </img>
