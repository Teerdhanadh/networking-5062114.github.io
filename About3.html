<h1>VARIOUS NETWORK COMMUNICATION STANDARDS :-</h1>
<P>The computers on a network may use different software, hardware and protocols.For the two computers to communicate with each other,they need to follow certain communication standards</P>
    <h3>ISO (International Standards Organisation):- </h3>
    <p>Dedicated to worldwide agreement on international standards in a variety of fields.ISO's effort in the field of information technology has resulted in the creation ofthe Open System Interconnection (OSI) model for network communication.</p>
    <h3>ITU-T (International Telecommunication Uinon-Telecommunication Standards Sector</h3>
    <p>is an international standards organization that develops standards for telecommunication.Two popular standards developed by ITU-T are the V series (V.32, V.33, and V.42) and the X series (X.25, X.400, and X.500).</p>
    <h3>ANSI (American National Standards Institute):-</h3>
    <p>is a private nonprofit organization. ANSI submits proposals to the ITU-T and is the designated voting member from the United States to the ISO.</p>
        <h3>IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers):-</h3>
        <p>is the largest national professional group involved in developing standards for computing, communication, electrical engineering, and electronics. It sponsored an important standard for local area networks called Project 802(the 802.3, 802.4, 802.5etc).</p>
            <h3>EIA (Electronics Industries Association):-</h3>
            <p>is an association of electronics manufacturers in the US.It is responsible for developing the EIA-232D and EIA-530 standards that define serial transmission between two digital devices (Ex computer to Modem).</p>
                <h3>IETF(Internet  Engineering  Task  Force):-</h3>
                <p>is  the  standards  body  for  the  Internet  itself.Important contributions include the development of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).</p>
