        <h1>CLASSIFICATION OF NETWORKS :-</h1>
        <h3>There are three types of Networks are there:-<br></h3>
        <h4>1.LAN  - (Local Area Netwok)</h4>
        <h4>2.WAN  - (Wide Area Network)</h4>
        <h4>MAN - (Metropolitan Area Network)</h4>
        <h2>LAN - (LOCAL AREA NETWORK) :-</h2>
        <img src="lanimage.jpg"align="right"width="300px"height="300px">
        <ul><li>
           A LAN is usually privately owned and links the devices in a single office,building,or campus. 
        </li><br>
    <li>LAN size is limited to few kilometes nearly 5-10 KMS.</li><br>
    <li>Local Area Network(LAN) has higher bandwidth rates with less cost.</li><br>
    <li>In general, a given LAN will use only one type of transmission medium.</li><br>
    <li>The most common LAN topologies are bus, ring, and star. </li><br>
    <li>LANs have data rates in the 4 to 16 Mbps range.</li><br>
    <li>Today, however speeds are increasing and can reach 100 Mbps with gigabit systems in development.</li><br></ul>
    <br>
    <h2>WAN - (WIDE AREA NETWORK) :-</h2>
    <img src="wanimage.png"align="right"width="300px"height="300px">
    <ul><li>A WAN provides long-distance transmission of data, voice, image, and video information over large geographical areas they may comprise a country, a continent, or even the whole world. </li><br>
    <li>WANs may utilize public, leased, or private communication devices, usually a combination</li><br>
<li>Wide Area Networks (WAN) has lower bandwidth rates compared with Local Area Network (LAN) with high cost.</li><br>
<li>Current Wide Area Networks runs on bandwidths of 4 Mbps, 8 Mbps, 20 Mbps, 50 Mbps or 100 Mbps. </li><br>
<li>Wide Area Network (WAN) depends mainly on Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for connection solutions.</li></ul><br>
<h2>MAN - (METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK) :-</h2>
<img src="manimage.png"align="right"width="300px"height="300px">
<ul><li>A MAN is designed to extend over an entire city.</li><br>
<li>It may be single network such as a cable television network, or it may be a means of connecting a number of LANs into a single network.</li><br>
<li>MAN size is limited to  50-100 KMS.</li><br>
<li>MANs have data rates in the 100 MBPS to 1 GBPS range.</li><br>
<li>A MAN may be wholly owned and operated by a private company, or it may be a service provided by a public company, such as a local telephone company. </li><br>
<li>Most commonly used technologies to develop a MAN network are FDDI ( Fiber distributed Data interface) , ATM ( Asynchronous Transfer Mode). </li><br></ul>
