        <h1>NETWORKING LINKS :-</h1>
        <p>There are two types of Networking links are there:-></p>
        <p>1.Wired Network Link</p>
        <p>2.Wireless Network Link</p>
        <h3>1. Wired Network</h3>
        <img src="wiredimage.png"align="right"width="500px"height="250px">
        <p>The following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking.</p>
    <ul><li>
    Coaxial cable is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks.<br>
     Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second.<br></li>
    <li>ITU-T G.hn technology uses existing home wiring (coaxial cable, phone lines and power lines) to create a high-speed local area network.<br></li>
    <li>Twisted pair cabling is used for wired Ethernet and other standards. It typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized <br>
    for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction. <br>
    The transmission speed ranges from 2 Mbit/s to 10 Gbit/s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP)<br> 
    and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several category ratings, designed for use in various scenarios.</li>
    <li>An optical fiber is a glass fiber. It carries pulses of light that represent data via lasers and optical amplifiers.<br>
         Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity to electrical interference. <br>
         Using dense wave division multiplexing, optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different <br>
         wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent to up to trillions of bits per second. <br>
         Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for undersea cables to interconnect continents.<br>
          There are two basic types of fiber optics, single-mode optical fiber (SMF) and multi-mode optical fiber (MMF). Single-mode fiber has the <br>
          advantage of being able to sustain a coherent signal for dozens or even a hundred kilometers. Multimode fiber is cheaper to terminate but <br>
          is limited to a few hundred or even only a few dozens of meters, depending on the data rate and cable grade.</li></ul>

          <h3>2. Wireless Network</h3>
          <p>Network connections can be established wirelessly using radio or other electromagnetic means of communication.</p>
          <img src="wirelessimage.png"align="right"width="400px"height="250px">
          <ul><li>
            <h4>Terrestrial microwave :-</h4> Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes.<br>
             Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately 40 miles (64 km) apart.<br></li>
            <li><h4>Communications satellites :- </h4>Satellites also communicate via microwave. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit 35,400 km (22,000 mi) above the equator.<br>
                 These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.<br></li>
            <li><h4>Cellular networks :- </h4>use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area is served by a low-power transceiver.<br></li>
            <li><h4>Radio and spread spectrum technologies :- </h4>Wireless LANs use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable <br>
                communication between multiple devices in a limited area. IEEE 802.11 defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as Wi-Fi.</li>
            <li><h4>Free-space optical communication :- </h4>uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, line-of-sight propagation is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.</li>
            <li>Extending the Internet to interplanetary dimensions via radio waves and optical means, the Interplanetary Internet.</li>
            <li>IP over Avian Carriers was a humorous April fool's Request for Comments, issued as RFC 1149. It was implemented in real life in 2001.</li></ul>
           <br>
            <p></p>The last two cases have a large round-trip delay time, which gives slow two-way communication but doesn't prevent sending large amounts of information (they can have high throughput).</p></ul>
